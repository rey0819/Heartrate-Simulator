# Heartrate-Simulator
Using a FRDM-K64F development board, this is a script in the C programming language that simulates a person's heart rate using LEDs while displaying whether or not that heart rate is healthy. The user inputs three parameters: sex, age, and resting heart rate (in BPM) which can be found quite easily for the user. When the script is run with these parameters, the FRDM board blinks an LED at the same rate at which was inputted by the user, thus simulating their heart beat. On top of this, the color of the LED signals whether the heart rate is healthy or not depending on the inputted parameters for sex and age. Green means healthy, blue means dangerously slow, orange means unhealthy but not dangerous, and red is dangerously fast.
Since the heart is so important it is useful to know how well yours is working and whether or not that is healthy. Many issues with the heart can cause very high and very low heart rates for people which can cause serious injury (example: heart attacks, bradycardia). This simulator replicates those conditions.
