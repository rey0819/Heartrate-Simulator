# Heartrate-Simulator
Using a FRDM-K64F development board, this is a script in the C programming language that simulates a person's heart rate using LEDs while displaying whether or not that heart rate is healthy. The user inputs three parameters: sex, age, and heart rate in BPM which can be found quite easily for the user. When the script is run with these parameters, the FRDM board blinks an LED at the same rate at which was inputted by the user, thus simulating their heart beat. On top of this, the color of the LED signals whether the heart rate is healthy or not depending on the inputted parameters for sex and age. Green means healthy, blue means dangerously slow, orange means unhealthy but not dangerous, and red is dangerously fast.
